üì¶ Azure Storage Solution ‚Äî POE Part 1
üìå Project Overview

This project was developed as part of CLDV6212 ‚Äî POE Part 1.
The goal was to build an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that integrates with various Azure Storage Services.

The application demonstrates:

Storing structured customer and product information in Azure Table Storage.

Hosting images and multimedia content using Azure Blob Storage.

Managing order-related processing using Azure Queue Storage.

Storing dummy contracts using Azure File Share.

The solution is deployed to Azure App Service for cloud access.
